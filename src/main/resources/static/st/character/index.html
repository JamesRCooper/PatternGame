    To see a list of characters that you can load into the pool (I'm still working on the character upload
    part), just follow this <a href="/entity/character/">link</a>.
    <br><br>
    A character can only have a single occurrence in the pool. To see a list of characters already in the pool
    follow this <a href="/pool/players">link</a>.
    <br><br>
    To load a chaaracter into the pool (be able to use him/her), just type the name into the box below and
    click submit. It will return an ID. Make sure you keep this id. If you lose it, the server will need to
    be reset before you can use this character again.<br>
    <form action="/pool/place/" method="get" target="_blank">
        Name: <input type="text" name="characterName"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <br><br>
    After aquiring the token, the character can be placed in a room. To see a list of rooms follow this
    <a href="/pool/rooms">link</a>.
    <br><br>
    To place the active character in a room, paste the ID and room name in the corresponding boxes below and
    click submit.<br>
    <form action="/pool/moveToRoom" method="get" target="_blank">
        ID: <input type="text" name="activeId"><br>
        Room: <input type="text" name="roomName"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Place">
    </form>
    <br><br>
    To see a map of the room the character is now in, place the ID in the box below.<br>
    <form action="/pool/map" method="get" target="_blank">
        ID: <input type="text" name="activeId"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    To move the character around the map, go to this <a href="/st/movement.html">page</a>. I recommend having
    this page and the map page open in separate tabs. Eventually, I hope to set up a streaming service; but
    that will take someone who knows JavaScript(AngularJS) and HTML(BootStrap).
